## üìù Disabling games
In this bot you can disable games you don't want your users to be playing.
This can be done by setting ```false``` as the value of a certain game in the config file.

By default the config looks like this:

```
{
    "token" : "yourSuperSecretBotTokenHere",
    "prefix" : "!",
    "commandDisabledMessage" : "This game has been disabled in the bot's config. If you think this is an error, please contact the server owner.",
    "games" : {
        "2048" : true,
        "Connect4" : true,
        "Emojify" : true,
        "FastType" : true,
        "FindEmoji" : true,
        "Fishy" : true,
        "Flood" : true,
        "GuessThePokemon" : true,
        "Hangman" : true,
        "MatchPairs" : true,
        "Minesweeper" : true,
        "RockPaperScissors" : true,
        "Slots" : true,
        "Snake" : true,
        "TicTacToe" : true,
        "Trivia" : true,
        "Wordle" : true,
        "WouldYouRather" : true
    }
}
```

If you would like to disable game, just set ``true`` to ``false`` of the game you want to disable. For example disabling 2048, connect4, flood, snake and wordle:

```
{
    "token" : "yourSuperSecretBotTokenHere",
    "prefix" : "!",
    "commandDisabledMessage" : "This game has been disabled in the bot's config. If you think this is an error, please contact the server owner.",
    "games" : {
        "2048" : false,
        "Connect4" : false,
        "Emojify" : true,
        "FastType" : true,
        "FindEmoji" : true,
        "Fishy" : true,
        "Flood" : false,
        "GuessThePokemon" : true,
        "Hangman" : true,
        "MatchPairs" : true,
        "Minesweeper" : true,
        "RockPaperScissors" : true,
        "Slots" : true,
        "Snake" : false,
        "TicTacToe" : true,
        "Trivia" : true,
